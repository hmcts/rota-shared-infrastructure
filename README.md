# rota-shared-infrastructure

Shared per-environment resources for the rota services:

- PostgreSQL 16 database used as the optimiser control plane and worker-lease authority;
- Application Insights;
- the `rota-shared-<environment>` Key Vault;
- PostgreSQL connection secrets;
- an operationally seeded `optimiser-hmac-key` shared by the optimiser and worker deployments.

The HMAC key is not managed by Terraform. Seed the `optimiser-hmac-key` secret directly in each
environment's existing Key Vault before enabling the chart secret mount or HMAC enforcement.
Application charts enable HMAC and mandatory lease-token enforcement only in later rollout steps,
after both clusters are running compatible worker images.
