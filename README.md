# rota-shared-infrastructure

Shared per-environment resources for the rota services:

- DAPDB and DOPDB PostgreSQL 15 Flexible Servers used by the Rota services;
- Application Insights;
- the `rota-shared-<environment>` Key Vault;
- PostgreSQL connection secrets;
- an operationally seeded `optimiser-hmac-key` shared by the optimiser and worker deployments.

The HMAC key is not managed by Terraform. Seed the `optimiser-hmac-key` secret directly in each
environment's existing Key Vault before enabling the chart secret mount or HMAC enforcement.
Application charts enable HMAC and mandatory lease-token enforcement only in later rollout steps,
after both clusters are running compatible worker images.

## PostgreSQL sizing

The databases are not hosted inside AKS. They remain Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
PaaS resources, with applications in AKS connecting to them over the delegated subnet. Consequently,
server sizing, storage, backup, high-availability, auto-grow and PostgreSQL tuning settings remain
applicable; running the client workloads in AKS does not replace those server-side concerns.

The DAPDB and DOPDB servers default to the development specification. Environment-specific sizing
is applied by setting the PostgreSQL variables in an environment's `<env>.tfvars` file, following the
standard HMCTS pipeline convention. `prod.tfvars`, `perftest.tfvars` and `aat.tfvars` (staging) supply the
full production sizing, high availability, retention and diagnostics values. `demo.tfvars` uses the
production sizing but with high availability disabled. Environments without an override file (`dev`,
`sandbox`, `ithc`) use the development defaults declared in `variables.tf`.

The existing generic `postgresql-*` Key Vault secrets and `postgresql_fqdn` output now refer to
DAPDB for compatibility. Explicit `dapdb-postgresql-*` and `dopdb-postgresql-*` secrets are also
created.

### Differences from the legacy CPP-managed PaaS deployment

The HMCTS PostgreSQL module used for AKS-hosted applications does not expose every integration option
used by the legacy CPP PostgreSQL module, so the following have not been added outside the module:

- the Monday 02:00 UTC maintenance window (the AKS module currently fixes this to Sunday 03:00 UTC);
- production diagnostic settings targeting the shared `LA-MPD-INT-WS` workspace, including all
  metrics (the module's Query Performance Insight option creates a separate workspace and overrides
  query-capture settings, so it is not equivalent);
- the legacy CPP Entra role/group model and its external credential-vault integration.
